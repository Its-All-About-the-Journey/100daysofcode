#The following will equal 7:
print(3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3)
#While this will equal 3:
print(3 * (3 + 3) / 3 - 3)

#Floor Division, //  - this will produce an integer result instead of a float result:
print(8 // 3)

#Shorthand for manipulating a variable: var += 3 will add 3 to the variable "var"

#f-string - allows you to convert multiple data types into a string as string, include the variable to be converted in {}
