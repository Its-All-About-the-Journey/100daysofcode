# DAY 16

# Description
OOP is introduced on this day.  Compares with Procedural Programming.
We imported the Turtle module, but that was short lived.
We then went into PyPi (Python Package Index) to check on prettytable
and she talked about how to install it in PyCharm.

We rebuilt the coffee exercise from yesterday but in an OOP way.
Actually, we didn't build, so much as she built it, and we implemented it.
