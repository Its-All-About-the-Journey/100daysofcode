# DAY 24

# Description
Learned about walking files and directories, opening text files, writing to text files, and modifying text files in a programmic way (replacing content using variables). Edited our snake game to utilize a "score.txt" file to maintain the high score after exiting the game, and created a "mail merge" app that creates a series of invitation letters based on names in an input file.

# Environment
OS: Windows 10

Python version: 3.9.1

# Dependencies

# How to run script
```
either python mail-merge-app/main.py
OR
python snake-game.py
```

# Sample output
```
Either generates the letters using the input files in mail-merge-app/Input/Names and Letters folders, or pops up the Snake game (respectively).
```
