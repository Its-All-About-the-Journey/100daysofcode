# DAY 15

# Description
Learned about importing variables from other files and using them in our code. Probably over-engineered my solution as it keeps the coins separated into each denomination, and then dispenses change in the largest denominations possible.

# Environment
OS: Windows 10

Python version: 3.9.1

# Dependencies

# How to run script
```
python coffee-machine.py
```

# Sample output
```
What would you like? (latte/espresso/cappuccino) espresso
Please insert coins.
How many quarters?: 10
How many dimes?: 5
How many nickles?: 4
How many pennies?: 3
Here is your espresso. Enjoy!
```
