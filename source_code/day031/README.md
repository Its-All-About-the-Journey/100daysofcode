# DAY 31

# Description
Built a flashcard application for learning words. Takes input from a CSV files of two categories (IE: questions + answers), displays a question for 3 seconds, then flips to the answer. If you get it right, it removes the question from the list and saves it to a new file, which is then loaded each time you launch the application. Learned a bit more about how to use the window.after and window.after_cancel functions.
