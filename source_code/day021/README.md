# DAY 21

# Description
Today's video continued with the Snake game.  This time around the exercises
include inheritance, and slicing lists.  

I created two version of the snake game.  In snake1, it sort of follows the
course but I may have not used inheritance in a few of the modules.

In snake2, I wanted to used dictionaries instead of a list for the snake 
segments.  I thought it would improve the lapsed time on a game cyle since it
was not going to be updating each segments position like in v1.  Instead the
snake head updates it self with the heading/forward, and the only two segments
that needed attention were the tail head (segment after head) and the tail end.

In the end, the time lapsed were pretty similar between both versions. xD  
Oh well, it was fun.  I may comeback to this and try to improve it.
