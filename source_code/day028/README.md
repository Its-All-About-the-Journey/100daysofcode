# DAY 28

# Description
This lesson taught us a great deal about building a python GUI application with more advanced functions (resetting UI, embedding images, layering, cancelling functions, timers). I also included the "pop to front" function she described in the first lesson but didn't get to in the course.

# Environment
OS: Windows 10

Python version: 3.9.1

# Dependencies

# How to run script

python main.py
```

# Sample output

Pops up a Pomodoro timer application
```
