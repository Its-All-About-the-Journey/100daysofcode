# Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.
# Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.
# e.g. 86 is even because 86 ÷ 2 = 43
# 43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.
# e.g. 59 is odd because 59 ÷ 2 = 29.5
# 29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, so the division is not clean.
# The modulo is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python. It gives you the remainder after a division.

#Write your code below this line 👇

if number % 2 >= 1:
    print("This is an odd number.")
else:
    print("This is a even number.")

if number % 2 == 0:
    print("This is a even number.")
else:
    print("this is an odd number.")
