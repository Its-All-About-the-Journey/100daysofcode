# DAY 25

# Description
Learned about reading in CSV files, working with their data, modifying them and rewriting them. Learned about the pandas library for manipulation of dataframes/series. Went a bit overboard with the code on my state guessing game (it populates the states that have been guessed if you reopen the game, and also checks to see if the location you clicked is within the state you guessed (or a close approximation)).

# Environment
OS: Windows 10

Python version: 3.9.1

# Dependencies

# How to run script
```
python us-states-game/main.py
```

# Sample output

Pops up a US state guessing game
