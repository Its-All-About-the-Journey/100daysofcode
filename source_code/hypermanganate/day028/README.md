# DAY 28

Tomato Timer

# Description

Use the Tomato Timer to plot out work in chunks that allows you a braek to avoid fatigue.

I suggest instead using WorkRave but the Tomato works as well.

As a bonus, the tomato increases size until the timer ends, further adding to the anxiety of staring at it.
