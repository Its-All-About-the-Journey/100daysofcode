# How to run script

Call the script.
You'll be presented with a flash card of a concept.
See if you remember what it means.
After three seconds, the answer will be revealed.

If you knew it, click the Checkmark button.
If you didn't, press the X button to have the card come back again for practice.

After you've learned all the cards, the game ends.

If you desire, you can close out of the game when you don't feel you can learn any more, and pick up where you left off.

After you've learned all the words, the next time you open the application the deck recycles for practice.
