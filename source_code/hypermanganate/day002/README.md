# Description

Tip Calculator, January 2021 Edition.

This application will assist in computing the tip for a meal, be it dine-in, delivery, or curbside.
Remember - for delivery and curbside, not all party members need be present when it comes time to give.

# Environment
OS: Ubuntu Bionic

Python version: 3.6.9

# Dependencies

# How to run script
```
Execute the script.

Follow the prompt to enter the total of the meal's check, omitting any dollar signs.
Next, enter the number of diners in the party.
Finally, enter the percentage of tip you'd like to leave. Some guidance is provided. Please, do not enter the % symbol.

You will receive your answer.
```

# Sample output
```
Welcome ... to the tip calculator!

Enter the total amount of the check: 10

And how many are dining today? 4

Now comes the time to pass judgement.
Select a tip percentage, but choose wisely.
Remember - these are trying times.

For example:
     For any reasonable meal with a party of four or more, enter '18' for an 18% gratuity.
     Poor service may warrant something like 12% or 15%, so you would enter '12' or '15'
     Good service maybe has earned 20%, so in that case enter '20'. Is there a limit to your generosity?

Choose: 25

It has been decided. Your party will leave a 25% tip, resulting in a $2.50 gratuity.
Each of the 4 members should contribute $0.62, or more.
