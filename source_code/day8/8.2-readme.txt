Prime numbers are numbers that can only be cleanly divided by itself and 1. 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number)


**You need to write a function** that checks whether if the number passed into it is a prime number or not.

e.g. 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and 2.

But 4 is not a prime number because you can divide it by 1, 2 or 4.

2. Make sure you name your function/parameters the same as when it's called on the last line of code. 

3. Use the same wording as the Example Outputs to make sure the tests pass.
