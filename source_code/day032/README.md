First you will need to configure your email account to allow less secure applications to send email. Then you will need
to put your own email and password credentials into the application in lines 7 and 8 of main.py:

MY_EMAIL = 'yourEmail@gmail.com'
MY_EMAIL_PASS = 'yourEmailPassword'

I used enviroment variables on my PC to test the application. You can use that format if you wish so.

Afterwards, modify the birthdays.csv with names, emails and birthdays of the individuals you wish to contact.

Run the application.
