# DAY 19

# Description
Learned more about screen interfaces, capturing input for interfaces, and prompts/execution. I overengineered my solution again, but it accepts input for number of racers, creates independent objects per racer, and accepts screen input for the user's guess. It also draws a finish line.

OS: Windows 10

Python version: 3.9.1

# Dependencies
